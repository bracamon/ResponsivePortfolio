# Alfredo's Responsive Portfolio

I used the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. This responsive portfolio faciliates a consistent experience across a variety of devices and screen sizes.

## This portfolio features the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images


## Portfolio Parameters:

* Functional, deployed application.

* GitHub repository with README describing the project.

* Navbar is consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page contains functional links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* Use semantic html.

* Each page has valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

* Contains my personalized information. (bio, name, images, etc.)

* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.
